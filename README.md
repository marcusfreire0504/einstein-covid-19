# De-identified Laboratory tests data for Covid-19

Here are my attempts to find a good predictive model for the Kaggle "competition" called [De-identified Laboratory tests data for Covid-19](https://www.kaggle.com/einsteindata4u/covid19/). Anyone is free to use my code to be inspired and try something different.

A HTML file with my results are available at [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mnunes/einstein-covid-19/blob/master/code.html). I got a very good sensitivity (0.99528), but my specificity (0.05036) is very low.
